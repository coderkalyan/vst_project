This is the Video Scheduling Table (VST) Project.

Here are guidelines to contribute:

Create a new branch with a codename and version number.

Codenames are as follows:

For each major release/change (such as major overhauls to libvst or dramatic UI changes), name it after a different fruit and change major version number:

Example: 1.0 Pomegranate > 2.0 Pear

For each minor release/change (such as optimizations and minor renamings in UI), add/change an adjective to the fruit and change minor version number:

Example: 1.0 Pomegranate > 1.1 Zesty Pomegranate

Adjectives should go from A-Z.

Major releases should not have an adjective.

For info on the VST specification, see the VST draft specification.

Please commit regularly and give descriptive commit messages (not just "Bug Fixes" - "Fixed a memory leak" or "Patched security issue" would be much better).

Thank You :)
