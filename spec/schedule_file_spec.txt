Video Scheduling Table Draft Specification
__________________________________________

This document describes the format to be used with all Video Scheduling Tables (VST).

All entries in a VST shall be of this format:

(hours)(minutes) (seconds) (video file) (flags)
|  |-----|        |          |           |
|  |  |-----------|          |           |
|  |  |    |-----------------|           |
|  |  |    |               |-------------|
12 13 26 /home/foo/bar.mp4 none

In other words:

A VST entry shall consist of the hour desired (in 24 hour time format), separated by a space, followed by the desired minute, separated by another space, followed by the seconds, followed by a space, followed by the path to the video file desired to be played.

Here are a few sample entries:

8 35 00 /home/bar/flag.mp4 none <--- plays "flag.mp4" at 8:35:00 AM.

15 02 55 /home/john/random.mov none <--- plays "random.mov" 5 seconds before last bell rings at Harvest Park (or 3:02:55 PM).

If a video has no specified time to be played and is desired to be played manually, use -1 as the value for all time values.

For example, to load "leadership.avi" but play it manually, you would enter:

-1 -1 -1 /home/jane/leadership.avi none

To specify a video flag, such as looping a video, enter it in an entry like so:

8 31 00 /home/foo/intro.wmv loop

In order to load a text file containing VST entries, use Python:

python3
import libvidsched
schedload("path/to/text/file.txt")
